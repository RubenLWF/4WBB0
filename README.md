# 4WBB0 - Engineering Design, Group 6

This repo was used for keeping and maintaining the software for our engineering desing project.

## About the project

In the project our group was tasked with designing and creating an innovative product related to sustainability. We came up with a device that would automatically open or close your blinds based on the temperature and sun intensity.

## Implimentation

### Hardware
To realize our idea we have developed two seperate units.
- **Inside unit:** This unit exists of an ESP32 micro-controller with an AM2320 temperature sensor and a stepper motor to move the blinds in a 3D printed housing. 
- **Outside unit:** This unit exists of an ESP32 micro-controller with an AM2320 temperature sensor and an BH1750 light intensity meter.
